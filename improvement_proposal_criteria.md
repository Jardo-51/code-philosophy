# Criteria For Accepting Improvement Proposals

## 1. Advantages Must Exceed Disadvantages

The proposal must solve some problem or bring an improvement. That implies the new solution will bring advantages compared to the legacy solution, but also may cause some disadvantages.

Potential advantages/disadvantages to consider:

  - Improved/worsened user experience
  - Improved/worsened end product quality
  - Improved/worsened productivity (of programmers/managers/analysts/testers/...)
  - Improved/worsened code quality:
    - robustness (susceptibility to human errors)
    - readability
    - maintainability
    - extensibility
    - efficiency
  - Reduced/increased boilerplate code

## 2. Real-world Working Example

The proponent must provide a working example of his proposal applied to the real project code, which demonstrates the advantages from the first point. This would typically be a branch of the project with the change implemented.

The example must fulfill the following criteria:

  - Works (able to compile and run the code)
  - Satisfies all business requirements
  - Demonstrates the new solution on the most complicated part of the project
